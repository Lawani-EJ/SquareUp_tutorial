# Overview of SquareUP

## Task 1
- [x] **Create your account**

  To start building on the Square Developer platform, create a free Square developer account.  
  The sign-up process involves a short series of prompts that collect information to create your account and register your first application.

## Task 2
- [x] **Making the first API call**

After you create an account and application ,you can use API Explorer to call Square APIs. This exercise creates a payment in the 
Square Sandbox.

- In API Explorer, choose Run Request.
- Review the Request and Response panes:
    - The Request pane shows the request that was sent. You can change the default cURL view to see the request in another programming language.
    
    - The Response pane shows the response from Square. If the payment is successful, Square returns a Payment object with the status field set to COMPLETED. If the request failed, Square returns an error.

The source_id in the request is a Sandbox payment token
 that represents a credit card. In production, payment tokens are generated by the Web Payments SDK
 or In-App Payments SDK
.

## Task 3
- [x] **Viewing the API Logs**
You can view API logs: 
 for your application in the Developer Console.

 - In the Response pane of your the API call
 in API Explorer, choose View Logs. This opens the Developer Console to the API Logs page for your application.

- Choose the API call from the results list.

- To view the HTTP request, choose Request.

- To view the response, choose Response.

# Day 2
- [x] The building basics with square
The following design concepts and patterns are useful to understand as you develop applications on the Square Developer platform:
1. Versioning in Square API's
2. Access Tokens and Other Square Credentials
3. Frontend and Backend Development (I like this one)
4. General Development Concepts.
5. Common Data Types
6. Common Square API Patterns.
7. Square eCommerce APIs
8. Square API Lifecycle

# Day 3
## Versioning in the square API:  
Describes versioning and version-naming schemes used for the Square API and SDKs. The Square API uses a ```YYYY-MM-DD``` version-naming scheme that indicates the date the API version is released. This versioning scheme is used to control breaking changes and allows you to test newer API versions before upgrading your application. The API version applies to all Square APIs, such as the Payments API, Orders API, and Customers API.

Each application registered in the Developer Console has a default API version, which you can view or change on the Credentials page for the production or Sandbox environment. The default API version is pinned to the application and used for all API requests unless overridden in the Square-Version header.

The following request omits the Square-Version header, which directs Square to use the default API version:

``` bash
curl https://connect.squareup.com/v2/payments \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

To override the default and test different API versions, explicitly specify the API version in the Square-Version header (or corresponding SDK client parameter):

``` bash 
curl https://connect.squareup.com/v2/payments \
  -H 'Square-Version: 2024-07-17' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

# Day 4
Access Tokens and Other Square Credentials
Access tokens are credentials that allow applications to securely interact with Square APIs. An access token authenticates your application and authorizes access to resources in a Square account, such as customers, orders, and payments. Proper credential management and storage is critical for maintaining security.

## Access Token types
1. Personal access tokens.
2. OAuth access tokens.
